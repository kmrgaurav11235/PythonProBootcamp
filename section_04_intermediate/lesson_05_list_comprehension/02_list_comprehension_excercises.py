# ----------------- Question 1 -----------------
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain
# every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.
# e.g. 4 * 4 = 16
# 4 squared equals 16.
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:



# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(squared_numbers)

# ----------------- Question 2 -----------------
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the
# even numbers from the list numbers.
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

# Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:



# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(result)

# ----------------- Question 3 -----------------
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings.



# Write your code above ğŸ‘†

print(result)
