# Write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word 
# TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 
# For Love Scores **less than 10** or **greater than 90**, the message should be:
#   "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, the message should be:
#   "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#   "Your score is **z**."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
