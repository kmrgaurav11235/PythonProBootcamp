# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#   on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#       except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#           unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
if year % 400 == 0:
  print("Leap year.")
elif year % 100 == 0:
  print("Not leap year.")
elif year % 4 == 0:
  print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
